### an R script

# here we'll learn to run code and perform basic operations

# write a bit of code:
print("hello world")
# keep your cursor on the line, then evaluate by:
# - clicking "run" in the GUI or
# - cmd + enter (other shortcuts exist)

# follow the same procedure with multiple lines by first highlighting:
2 + 3
print("hello world")

# code can also be run directly in the console (the window below)
# tip: using the arrow key allows you to quickly recover code you've executed (which makes editing much faster!)
# tip: don't get attached to code you've executed in the console; if you want to keep it, put it in the document

# assignment is the most basic command and follows the form:
# <name> <assign> <data>
# in R, assignment can be done using <- or =
# try assigning data to a name
x <- 2 + 3
# you can display the object by entering the name or using `print()`
x
print(x)

## try basic mathematical operations (*, +, /, -) with R
# 1. choose a number and assign it to variable `x`
# 2. multiple x by 3
# 3. add 6
# 4. divide by 3
# 5. subtract x
